# Data Structures and Algorithms

_This repository provides implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. It serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning these fundamental concepts._

### Data Structures:

- List the data structures included in the repository. For each data structure, consider providing:
- A brief definition and explanation of its purpose.
- Time and space complexity analysis(image)

- Here's a basic example for an array:

- **Array**: A linear collection of elements, accessed by zero-based indexing.
  - **Time complexity:**
    - **Access:** O(1) (average)
    - **Search:** O(n) (linear search)
    - **Insertion/Deletion:** O(n) (average, can be optimized in some cases)
  - **Space complexity:** O(n) (proportional to the number of elements stored)
  - **Use cases:** Storing lists, sequences, collections of similar data types.

### Algorithms:

- List the algorithms included in the repository. For each algorithm, consider providing:

  - A clear explanation of what the algorithm does and its problem-solving approach.
  - Time and space complexity analysis.
  - Pseudocode or code implementation (if applicable) with comments.
  - Comparison to other relevant algorithms for efficiency or suitability.

- Here's a basic example for sorting:

  - **Sorting Algorithm** (e.g., Bubble Sort): Orders a list of elements in ascending or descending order.
  - **Time complexity**: O(n^2) (worst-case), can be improved to O(n log n) with more efficient algorithms.
  - **Space complexity:** O(1) (in-place sorting)
  - **Explanation:** Bubble Sort iterates through the list, repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order.
